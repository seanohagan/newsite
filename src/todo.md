Todo for the site
- make new index (done)
- we want the about, and then the latest (done)
- probably the best approach is to serve it as html, rather than making a layout (bc its a one-off page), so redo it from how i currently have it
- Logo and favicons (done)
- Rewrite latest to be a shortlist, without links (i.e. not reading from a blog, but just news.) (done)

New todo:
- better solution for news-- json is not ideal, should be able to include html/md
