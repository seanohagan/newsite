I'm a fourth year PhD student in the department of statistics at the University of Chicago working with Veronika Ročková. 

My research aims to reconcile the inferential rigor of Bayesian statistics with the predictive power and scalability of modern machine learning systems. My work treats the relationship between these fields as symbiotic and transfers ideas in both directions. This involves exporting statistical methods for uncertainty quantification into large-scale predictive models, as well as importing the capabilities of these predictive systems to elicit informative priors and accelerate Bayesian computation.
