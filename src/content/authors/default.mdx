I'm a fourth year PhD student in the department of statistics at the University of Chicago working with Veronika Ročková and Aaron Schein. 

My research aims to reconcile the inferential rigor of Bayesian statistics with the predictive power and scalability of modern machine learning systems. To this end, I am interested in developing methodology that facilitates a bidirectional transfer of ideas: enhancing uncertainty quantification for performant predictive models, while complementarily leveraging their capabilities for prior elicitation and to address certain computational challenges in approximate Bayesian inference.
